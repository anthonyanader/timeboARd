## Vision
>We're Git for brainstorming through the medium of Augmented Reality

Wanting to change the way teams catalog brainstorming sessions, we developed Team Bo[AR]d, a native iOS app, that enables users to collaborate, share and upload a series of 3D whiteboard sessions through Augmented Reality. Users have a time machine, flip through versioning view of all saved frames in real-time.

## Problem Solved
Space is limited- whiteboards must be ~~erased~~  However, now anyone can log into Team Bo[AR]d, anchor the canvas with only two taps and find a catalog of their 3D  image collection loaded in a few seconds.

## Who is this for?
Anyone. Anyone who engages in group activities and brainstorming sessions. Engineers, Students, Professors, Marketers, Advertisers, Analysts, Managers...

## Roadmap
Due to the timing constraints for this hackathon, we were unable to complete all the features of our application.

Our next update will include seamless collaboration for two or more members editing and working on a board simultaneously. This portion of the application will be the primary focus of our next release.

## Contributors and Maintainers
There are no formal contributing guidelines at the moment as things are still in the early stages and we might find a better approach to design and architect the app. Anyone is welcome to contribute whatever they think will be helpful to improve this project.
