##Vision
>We're Git for Whiteboards using Augmented Reality

Wanting to change the way teams catalog brainstorming sessions, we developed Team Bo[AR]d, a native iOS app, that enables users to collaborate, share and upload a series of 3D whiteboard sessions through Augmented Reality. Users have a time machine, flip through versioning view of all saved frames in real-time.

##Problem Solved
Space is limited- whiteboards must be ~~erased~~

##Who is this for?
Simply, every thinker out there. Anyone who engages in group activities and brainstorming sessions. Engineers, Students, Professors, Marketers, Advertisers, Analysts, Managers...

##Roadmap
In this version of the App, we used this that

Seemless collaboration by having two or more members editting and working on a board simultaneously. This portion of the application will be our next focus.
